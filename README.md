# ultimatum-game
A server enabling multiple clients to play the [ultimatum game](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/u/Ultimatum_game.htm), a well-known experimental economics game. It records the result of each game in a csv file.

I wrote this program to build on the basic C I learned in CS50, and to learn about socket programming. It also gave me the chance to learn about basic POSIX threading.
